# [JSON Database](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65)

## About
Acquire skills of working with JSON to use this tool as part of your work as a software developer. You will create a 
functional server that exchanges data with a web browser and handles multiple requests using parallelization.

### Stage 1: [Create a database](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/348/implement)
#### _Summary_
Create a simple array-based database that can store up to a thousand cells of data.

#### _Description_
A JSON database is a single-file database that stores information in JSON format. It is typically accessed remotely 
over the internet.

In this stage, you will simulate a database that can store text information in a string array of fixed size 1000. 
Initially, each cell (or element) in the database contains an empty string. Users will be able to perform three 
primary actions: saving strings to cells, reading information from cells, and deleting information from cells. When 
a string is deleted, the corresponding cell should revert to containing an empty string.

Users can interact with the database using the following commands: `set`, `get` and `delete`. A fourth command 
`exit` is used when the user is finished.

### Stage 2: [Connect it to a server](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/349/implement)
#### _Summary_
Create a server that allows clients to connect and send messages.

### Stage 3: [Add new functionalities](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/350/implement)
#### _Summary_
Make your server functional and add the option to exit the program.

### Stage 4: [Start work with JSON](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/351/implement)
#### _Summary_
Convert requests and responses to JSON format.

### Stage 5: [Manage mulitple requests](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/352/implement)
#### _Summary_
Allow your server to handle multiple requests at the same time.

#### _Description_


### Stage 6: [Store JSON objects in your database](https://hyperskill.org/projects/65/stages/353/implement)
#### _Summary_
Process operations with complex keys.
